            <h1>Choose Your Destination</h1>
            <p>When choosing your travel destinations, it depends on factors like:

                your personal travel style
                your interests
                the length of time you have available
                and your finances.
                Figure those things out first, then your options for where you can go start to take shape.

            <h2>Deals and Discounts</h2>
            <p>Hotel occupancy rates in London since the Olympics have been rising and hoteiliers do not need to heavily discount their prices. Booking online or using a consolidator may save a little, but I am not aware of discounts for organisations being offered.</p>

            <h2>A Simple Perfect Place To Get Lost</h2>
            <p>Your feet or a rental bike are the perfect and inexpensive tools to get you where you want to go. They also make it easy to stop anywhere to pose for a selfie or just take a break and do some people-watching.
                Asking locals is the best approach to finding hidden gems and exploring new areas. If you don’t like asking random people in the street, just go to a cafe or bar and talk to the wait staff. They are used to making small talk and are (generally) happy to help. And who doesn’t want to show off their know-how of the neighborhood?</p>

            <p> Most people agree travelling is a good thing. People think it's exciting, almost invigorating to travel. Travelling is the best way to learn new things, whether it be a new language or new culture because you're experiencing it first hand instead of just reading or looking at pictures.</p>
